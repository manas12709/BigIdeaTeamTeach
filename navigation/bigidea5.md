## Unintended Consequences

Technology often produces unforeseen effects. A single innovation can be perceived differently depending on personal and societal contexts:

- **Social Media Example:** While connecting people globally, social media also contributes to addiction and decreased productivity.

### Dopamine Feedback Loops
Social media platforms intentionally trigger dopamine release, creating addictive behaviors:

- **Health Issues:** Excessive use leads to sleep deprivation, anxiety, depression, and loneliness.
- **Productivity Loss:** Users often find themselves distracted, reducing their efficiency in tasks.
